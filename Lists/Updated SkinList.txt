(Xgar.io's skinList.txt stops here, and it contains all skins from Bubla's skinList.txt, however, it doesn't have every skin from Bubla.io. The skins that are missing are "Bowling", "Dog" (there's 2 versions of this skin, not to be confused with the "dog" skin from the skinList.txt file, which was originally called "Happy"), "Tennis", and "Orange". To make this file easier to understand, Halloweenx is just the first halloween coin skin, NinjaTest is a remaster of the Ninja skin that was never released, Tazer is the YouTuber TazerX's skin which was later released as a public skin in Fanix.io under the name "Owl", and Panoroma and Panoroma2 are two of an old developer's skins. I have no idea what XGradient is, but every skin listed before it are YouTuber skins except for Stussy's who is also staff, and Zero's who is the Xgar skin-maker's skin. No skinList.txt was found for Fanix.io in archive.org so I have to estimate using video evidence. I will also add "2" at the end of a Fanix.io skin that has the same name as a skin from Xgar.io's skinList.txt)
